The journey of learning and growth never stops, and right now, I’m at a pivotal moment in mine. As I enter the final semester of my Master’s in Computer Science at the University of Texas at Arlington, I’m reflecting on the challenges I’ve tackled, the skills I’ve honed, and the exciting opportunities that lie ahead.

## The Journey So Far

My academic and professional experiences have shaped me into the engineer I am today. From Supporting courses data structures & algorithms and database systems as a Graduate Teaching Assistant to optimizing large-scale data pipelines in my past role as a Software Engineer at Integral Ad Science, every challenge has strengthened my problem-solving mindset and technical expertise. Throughout this journey, I’ve had the chance to work with cloud technologies, big data tools, and backend development — each experience reinforcing my passion for building scalable and efficient systems.

## Actively Seeking Opportunities

As I transition from academia to industry, I’m actively looking for full-time software engineering roles where I can contribute my skills in backend development, cloud computing, and big data engineering. I am particularly excited about opportunities that involve:

--Scalable system design – Optimizing performance, designing efficient architectures, and working with distributed systems.
--Cloud & big data technologies – Leveraging AWS, Spark, and data pipelines to solve complex problems.
--Backend engineering – Developing robust APIs, microservices, and data-driven applications.

## Open to New Challenges

I’m open to roles in software engineering, Data engineering, and ML engineering, and I’m eager to join a team where I can learn, contribute, and grow. If you know of any opportunities or have advice to share, I’d love to connect!

## A Note of Gratitude

I’m grateful for the incredible mentors, peers, and professors who have supported me along this journey. Their insights and encouragement have been invaluable, and I look forward to bringing that same energy and passion into my next role.
If you're hiring or know of any opportunities that align with my skill set, feel free to reach out. Let’s build something great together!
